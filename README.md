# Netlify_Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for a static website hosted on netlify, which is my personal [portfolio](https://philippedesmarais.netlify.app/).

The website is unfortunately not mobile-compatible, and has not been tested with Internet Explorer, so I wouldn't be surprised if it had layout issues with those systems
